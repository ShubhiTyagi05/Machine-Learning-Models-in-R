#T-test
#The basic idea behind t-test is the inference problem from a small sample size data set to test 
#whether its sample mean may have large deviation from the true population mean.

#A very common problem you will encounter is having two data sets and you want to test whether 
#the two sets are coming from the same (assuming) normal distributions.

#In t-test, the null hypothesis is that the mean of the two samples is equal. This means that the
#alternative hypothesis for the test is that the difference of the mean is not equal to zero. 
#In a hypothesis test, we want to reject or accept the null hypothesis with some confidence 
#interval. Since we test the difference between the two means, the confidence interval in this 
#case specifies the range of values within which the difference may lie.

#The t-test will also produce the p-value, which is the probability of wrongly rejecting the null
#hypothesis. The p-value is always compared with the significance level of the test. 
#For instances, at 95% level of confidence, the significant level is 5% and the p-value is 
#reported as p<0.05. Small p-values suggest that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. 
#The smaller it is, the more confident we can reject the null hypothesis.


#Use the sleep data from R where there are 20 samples in two groups (group 1 and 2, each with 
#10 samples) that show the effect of two soporific drug to increase the hours in sleep

#there is naturally an overlap but the mean (half of the rectangle height) is different. 
#Can we confidently say that the two groups have different means?

#Based on the result, you can say: at 95% confidence level, there is no significant difference 
#(p-value = 0.0794) of the two means. Here you should accept the null hypothesis that the two 
#means are equal because the p-value is larger than 0.05.  The maximum difference of the mean 
#can be as low as -3.37 and as high as 0.21.  


#Z-Test

#Z-Distribution

#Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation 

#You will find the same basic functions for other distributions you may need, such as
?dt() ; ?dpois() ; ?dbinom() ; ?dchisq()

#Draw a z curve, a density function for z, Z is a variable that is normally distributed 
#with the mean 0 and the standard deviation 1

#Create a sequence of numbers for your x axis , -4 to 4 with interval 0.01

#if you measure the blood pressure of a person and it turns out to be 72 then it's 
#quite possible that this person belongs to the population with the mean 90 and the 
#standard deviation 10 For this event to happen to draw a person that deviates to 72 
#or even lower blood pressure the probability that this would happen is 0.0359


#if you draw a random sample you are interested in not if this person has a blood pressure lower 
#than the certain mean, but what you are interested is whether this blood pressure deviates a certain amount 
#from the mean

#two-tailed test


#the p-value for this two-tailed test is 36 + 36, 72. So the p-value is 0.072.
#This is the probability that you would randomly draw a person from the population 
#that deviates 18 units up or down from the mean 90


#Z, the standard normal distribution
#it allows us to take a sample and then describe how much it deviates from a hypothesized population

#By looking up the area under the Z curve from your measurement and then further away from 
#the mean you will be able to tell how common it would be to to take such a sample
#or a more extreme sample. This area is also referred to as the p-value

#If the sample deviates a lot from the mean we are going to reject the null hypothesis
#and state that this sample probably belongs to some other distribution with a different mean.
#This is called the alternative hypothesis. A common choice is to reject
#the null hypotheses if the p-value is lower than 0.05


#Using the Z distribution to decide whether a sample belongs to a population or not is actually
#a hypothesis test and as such it's called the Z test
